# App-controlled Arduino robot
In this project we developped an Android application allowing us to communicate with our Arduino controlled robot. The communication is done via an ESP8266 module.

## Structure
### Application
The Android app is a fork from [the WiFly Remote](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.inex.wiflyremote). You can see the fork version [here](./Android).

### Arduino
The Arduino was connected to the ESP8266 module with the PIN 14. You can see the code used to handle the connection right [here](./Arduino).
